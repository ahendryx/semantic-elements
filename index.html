      <h4><strong>WHAT ARE THEY?</strong></h4>
      <p>In HTML, <mark>semantic elements</mark> (or <mark>tags</mark>) are used
      to define the different components of a webpage. The intention of these tags is to clearly
      identify the content they include rather than to apply any sort of style to it.
      It is preferred that style is applied to elements using <code><b>CSS</b></code>.</p>

      <h4><strong>WHAT ELSE ARE THEY GOOD FOR?</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Using semantic tags can make the reasoning behind your page structure more
      evident to any other developers who may need to work with your code.</li>
        <li>Another advantage is that they help assistive technologies interpret the content
          accurately, making your site more accessible.</li>
